# ISBM-2.0-Client-SDK

A Software Development Toolkit to assist anyone interested in trying out the Open Industrial Interoperability Ecosystem (OIIE)

### Objectives

Since OIIE involves multiple industry standards at different levels of the technology stack, it is helpful to have a basic implementation to experience the OIIE in action. This SDK includes sample C# code projects and two flavors of ISBM 2.0 Client Adapters, .Net Core 3.1 and .Net Standard 2.0. They support a wide range of .Net implementations and OS or hardware platforms; see details in the ISBM 2.0 Client Adapter Architecture Diagram. By using the adapter, you can deliver and receive CCOM messages (Common Conceptual Object Model) through ISBM services (ISA-95 Message Service Model) with just a few lines of code! It cuts down on the learning curve, and you can try out your ideas in using OIIE without having to dive into the technical details of the standards
